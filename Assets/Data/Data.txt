I am Tuk
Nice to meet you
Where are you from
What do you do
What do you like to do
What is your phone number
Do you have Facebook
Thanks so much
I really appreciate
Excuse me
I am sorry
What do you think
How does that sound
That sounds great
I am learning English
I do not understand
Could you repeat that please
Could you please talk slower
That helps a lot
What does this mean
How do you spell that
What do you mean
Can you help me
I am looking for my key
I do not know my size
Where can I find my clock
How much does this cost
I do not need a bag
Can someone help me carry this out
Can I have this delivered
How can I help you
I will be with you in a moment
What time is our meeting
When is the deadline
